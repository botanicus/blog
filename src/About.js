  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Thank you for visiting my humble blog.
    I'm a web developer with main focus on <span class="hashtag">Ruby</span> (with or without <span class="hashtag">Rails</span>),{' '}
    <span class="hashtag">JavaScript</span> (these days mainly <span class="hashtag">React.js</span>) and <span class="hashtag">Docker</span>.
    This is what I've been doing for the past {new Date().getFullYear() - 2008} years and what I genuinely enjoy doing.
