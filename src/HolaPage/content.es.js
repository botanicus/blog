        Please do not share this page with anyone and don't link to it from any web site.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page exists for your convenience, so that you have my contact even in case I change my email or delete my Telegram.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course feel free to link to <em>any other page</em> on this blog. Only this page <code>{window.location.href}</code> is on need-to-know only basis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for respecting my privacy!
      </p>

    <ContactInfo />

    <p style={{color: 'dimgrey', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>
      As I probably told you, I don't have WhatsApp, FB or even phone,
      so these are the only means of contacting me.
    </p>

    <div style={{marginTop: 30, fontSize: 18}}>
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} color="darkgreen" />{' '}
      <A href="/">Check out my blog</A>
