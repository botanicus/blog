      This is a quarterly selection of the best posts. <em>I also occasionally write stuff that I don't post on the blog.</em>

          Your ad blocker is enabled. This in some cases <em>might prevent submission of this form</em> (

          <h2>RSS feed</h2>

            At the moment I don't have RSS feed(s). If you'd like to have it, please <Email subject="RSS on your blog">let me know</Email>.

          <h2>Social media</h2>
          <p>
            At the moment I'm not on any social media. I made that decision to <A href="/posts/bye-bye-facebook">protect my sanity</A> and I'm not going to change my mind.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe in personal contact and longer form posts, which require some attention, and have a message that's worth the time â€“ not mindless blabbering about how many pints one might have downed in Old Ponny's last night.
